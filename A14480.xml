            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>IRGIL</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Maro,</hi> was borne but of meane parentage, eſpecially on the fatherſide, who was called <hi>Maro,</hi> whom ſome ſuppoſe to haue bin a potter, but moe thinke that he was at the firſt, couenaunt ſeruant w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a traueilinge wyſeman, and afterward for his towardnes, by mariadge of his daughter: became his ſoonne in lawe, whom when his father in lawe had put in truſt with his huſbandrie, and his catteyle, and byinge of wooddes, and lookinge to Bées, therby he increaſed his ſmale ſubſtance. He was borne the yéere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>M. Licinius Craſſus</hi> were firſt <hi>Conſuls</hi> the .15. day of Octobre, in a village called <hi>Andes,</hi> not far from
<hi>Mantua.</hi> His mother <hi>Maia,</hi> beinge great with childe with him, and dreaminge that ſhe was deliuered of a laurell bowe, which prickt into the grownde grew forthwith to a great trée, replenyſhed with ſundrie kindes of Frutes, and Flowers: the next morning walking forth into the countrey with her huſband, ſtept a ſide, and was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therby, in a ditche. The report goeth, that the childe ſo ſoone as he was borne neuer cried, but looked ſo pleaſantly, that he gaue an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope that by his birth ſome notable thinge ſhould chaunce.</p>
            <p>There befell alſo another ſtrange token, for a <hi>Poplar</hi> trée branch, which was prickt into the grownd accordinge as the manner of the countrey at womens traueiles is, ſo grewe vp in ſhort ſpace, that it matched in bignes many great <hi>Poplar</hi> trées, that were ſet there long before, whiche was afterwarde conſecrated, and called by the name of <hi>Virgils</hi> trée, and had in great reuerence amongſt téemynge women, and ſuch as were with child, which daily made prayers, and offringes there. His infancie, that is to ſay, vntill he was ſeauen yeare old, he paſſed in <hi>Cremona,</hi> and when he was thirtéene yéere of age he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the garment of manſtate, when thoſe were made <hi>Conſuls</hi> agayne<pb facs="tcp:19872:4"/>that were when he was borne, and it fortuned that <hi>Lucretius</hi> the poet departed the ſame day. But
<hi>Virgil,</hi> from <hi>Cremona</hi> went to <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> and ſhortly after from thence to <hi>Naples,</hi> where dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly applying the ſtudie of the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> toonges: at length betooke himſelf to <hi>Phyſicke,</hi> and knowledge of the <hi>Mathematicals,</hi> wherin he ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all other in ſkill, and departinge to <hi>Rome,</hi> fell in fauour with the M. of the horſe to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and cured the horſes of manie, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie diſeaſes. Who commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded therfore that
<hi>Virgill</hi> ſhuld haue ſuch allowance of bread, as other of the ſtable had.</p>
            <p>Duringe this tyme the <hi>Crotoniati</hi> ſent vnto
<hi>Caeſar</hi> for a preſent, a goodlye horſecolt, that in all mens iudgment would proue both verie couragious, and woonderfull ſwift. When
<hi>Virgil</hi> beheld him he told the M. of the ſtable, that he was fooled of a ſicke, and infected mare, and that he would proue nether ſtronge nor ſwift, as afterward it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, wherof when the M. of the ſtable had enformed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that his bread ſhuld be dubled, for reward. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, when there were certen Dogges ſent to
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> foorth of <hi>Spayne, Virgil</hi> both told what maner ones the ſiers were, &amp; what ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and ſwiftnes they would be of. Which when he vnderſtoode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he then commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded agayne that
<hi>Virgil</hi> ſhould haue ſo much more bread as he had before. The Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> doubtinge of himſelf whether he were ſunne to
<hi>Octauius</hi> or to ſome man elſe, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge that <hi>Virgil Maro</hi> could reſolue him, that knew ſo well the natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res and ſiers of horſes, and dogges: remoouing all companye aſide <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> called him into the priuie chambre, and aſked him there alone, if he knew what he was, and what abilitie he had to make men hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie? I knowe (ꝙ
<hi>Maro</hi>) that thou art <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and thou haſt almoſt equall power with the immortall goddes and that thou mayſt make happie whom thou liſte. Surely (ꝙ <hi>Caeſar</hi>) I am of this mind, that if y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> anſwer mée truly to that I ſhall aſke, I will make thée hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and bleſſed. I wold to god (ꝙ
<hi>Maro</hi>) that I could anſwere truly to that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> demaundeſt. Then ſayd the Emperour, ſome ſay I am ſunne to <hi>Octauius,</hi> and ſome ſuſpect that I am ſome other mans ſunne. Wherat <hi>Maro</hi> ſmylinge: I will ſone tell you that (ꝙ he) yf you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me in anſweringe that you commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The Emperour ſwore by an Oth that he wold take neuer a worde in ill part, yea and that he ſhuld not depart vnrewarded. Therwithall <hi>Maro</hi> fixinge his eyes faſt on the Emperours: it is an eaſie matter (ꝙ he) by other lyuinge<pb facs="tcp:19872:4"/>thinges to diſcerne the diſpoſition of the parentes, through ſkill of
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematickes,</hi> and <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> but in men it is not poſſible. Howbeit I am able to giue ſome probable iudgment, what trade of lyfe thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſed. To this <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gaue dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t eare what he wold ſay. Then <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſo far as I can perceaue (ꝙ he) thou art a Bakers ſun. The Emperour thereat was aſtunned, and marueiled much in his mind how that could come to paſſe. Marie then (ꝙ
<hi>Virgil</hi>) I will tell you why I iudge ſo. When as I foretold certen thinges which could nether be knowne, nor vnderſtoode but by ſuch as be very wel lerned: thou that art prince of all the wordle commaundidſt that I ſhuld haue a certen of bread giuen mée for a reward, which is the vſe ether of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or els of ſuch as are bakers children. This merie ieſt, pleaſed the Emperour wel, but henceforth (ꝙ he) y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſhalt not be rewarded by a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker but by a moſt valie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prince, &amp; eſtéemed him much, and commendid him to <hi>Pollio.</hi> He was of bodie and ſtature bigge, of colour tawnie, hardfauoured, ſycklie, for he was manytimes gréeued with payne in the ſtomack, iawes, and head, and ſome tymes he did ſpet blood. He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented but litle the vſe of deyntie meates and wyne. Some report that he was prone to the deteſtable ſinne with boyes. But the better ſort ſuppoſe rather that he loued them as

<hi>Grammarian,</hi> and <hi>Cebetes</hi> a <hi>Poet.</hi> Some likewyſe affirme that he had carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with <hi>Plotia Hieria.</hi> But
<hi>Aſconius Pedianus</hi> ſayth that he was woont to declare to ſome auntient me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that indéede he was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by <hi>Varius</hi> iointly to kéepe her, howbeit he erneſtly refuſed ſo to doe. In all other reſpectes he was of lyfe, language, and conuerſation ſo vpright: that through all <hi>Naples</hi> he was called, commonly
<hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi> And when haply he was ſéene at <hi>Rome,</hi>
(whether as he came very ſeldom) going abroade in the open ſtreetes if eny followed, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him: he wold turne away into the next houſe. When
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> offred him the goods of one that was baniſhed, he vtterly refuſed them He was worth in ſubſtance an hundred <hi>Seſtertia,</hi> which were giuen him through the liberalitie of his fréendes, &amp; he had an houſe in <hi>Rome</hi> in a place called <hi>Aeſquiliae</hi> neare to <hi>Mecoenas</hi> gardaynes, although he was accuſtomed much to withdrawe him ſelf into <hi>Campania</hi> and<pb facs="tcp:19872:5"/>
               <hi>Scicil.</hi> Whatſoeuer he requeſted of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> he neuer had deniall therof. Euery yéere he ſent monie abundantly to ſuccour his parentes which died when he was of lawfull yéeres, his father beinge blinde when he died, &amp; his two brethren the one ſurnamed <hi>Silo</hi> died while he was a child, and <hi>Flacchus</hi> when he was come to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtate, whoſe death he bewayleth vnder the name of <hi>Daphnis.</hi> Amonge other ſtudies (as I haue ſayd before) he chéefly applied himſelf to <hi>Phyſick</hi> and
<hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes.</hi> He neuer plead at barre more then one cauſe, and that but once, whom <hi>Meliſſus</hi> reporteth to haue bin very ſlow of toongue, &amp; as though he were altogither vnlearned, when he firſt began
<hi>Poëtrie,</hi> he made this <hi>Diſthic,</hi> or theſe two verſes vpon one <hi>Baliſta</hi> a ſcholema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that for reporte of théeuery was couerid with an heape of ſtones.</p>

            </q>
            <p>After this he wroat <hi>Moretum, Priapus, Epigrammes, Dirae,</hi> and <hi>Culex</hi> when he was yet but fiftéene yéere old, the argument wherof is this. A ſhepheard wearyed with heat, and ſleapinge vnder a trée, when a ſerpent was cumming faſt towards him, there came a Gnat flying out of the Fenne nearby, and lighted on the ſheapheardes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head betwéene his temples, and there ſtunge him. Then he lyftinge vp his handes cruſhed the gnat, and when he eſpied the ſerpent: killed him alſo, and made a tombe for the gnat with this ſuperſcription.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thou litle gnat, the ſhepheard for thy due deſert to bee,</l>

            </q>
            <p>He wroat <hi>Aetna</hi> alſo, wherof ſome men doubt. But ſhortly after when he had begun <hi>Romane</hi> matters miſlikynge the ſharpnes, and roughnes both of the argument, and names, he fell to the
<hi>Bucolickes</hi> but cheifly to celebrate the name of <hi>Aſinius, Pollio, Alphenus Varus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Gallus,</hi> by cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the deuiſion of land beyond <hi>Padus</hi> amongſt the old ſouldiours after the conqueſt at <hi>Philippe</hi> made, at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundment of the
<hi>Triumuiri,</hi> or the Thre conſpiratours, they had ſaued him harmleſſe. Afterward he made his worke called <hi>Georgica</hi> in the honour of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> by whoſe meanes, when he was yet ſcarce knowne vnto him, he was aſſiſted againſt the old ſoldiours of
<hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> or rather as ſome ſuppoſe, againſt the violence of
<hi>Arius</hi> the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turian,</hi> by whom in that hurlyburly about deuiding of landes, he was very neare ſlayne. Laſt of all he tooke the
<hi>Aeneidos</hi> in hand, a worke of a diuerſe, and manifold argument, and reſemblinge, in a maner<pb facs="tcp:19872:5"/>both the workes of <hi>Homere.</hi> Beſides that it contayneth indifferenly both wordes, and matter aſwell
<hi>Greeke</hi> as <hi>Latine,</hi> and that cheife is which he moſt endeuored, it comprehendeth both the originall of the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour. When he wroate the <hi>Georgica,</hi> it is reported, how that euerie morninge he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to write a certen numbre of verſes, which he would all the day longe ouerlooke, and ſo abbridginge them, bringe them vnto a very fewe, not vnfitly ſayinge that he brought forth verſes, as the femall Bear doth her young and bringeth them into due faſhion by lickinge. The worke called <hi>Aeneidos</hi> he wrote firſt in twelue bookes in proſe (as ſome thinke) and afterward digeſted it into verſe. And otherſome iudge that if he had liued longer, he wold haue le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthned it vnto xxiiij. bookes euen vnto the time of
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and wold haue touched many other thinges therin, and with great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce haue ſet forth <hi>Auguſtus</hi> tyme, ſince that in writing, leaſt he ſhuld be vainly troubled with eny thinge: he left ſome thinges imperfect. And ſome thinges he wroate in very ſlender verſe, which (as he was woont, to ieſt) he ſayd he put in for Ieſters, and Minſtrels, to hold vp the worke, vntill the ſownd pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were framed. He abſolued his <hi>Bucoliks</hi> in thrée yéere, at
<hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Pollios</hi> requeſt. The ſame at that tyme ruled the prouince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Padus,</hi> by whoſe meanes and ſute, when the

This <hi>Pollio, Virgil</hi> loued entierly, and was likewiſe of him very welbeloued agayne, and great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly rewarded, for when he was vpon a tyme deſiered by him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and there ſodenlye ſurpriſed with the ſingulare beutie, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Alexander, Pollios</hi> boye: receaued him of gift.

            <p>
               <hi>Virgil</hi> loued this <hi>Gallus</hi> ſo well, that the fouerth booke of <hi>Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes</hi> from the middle to the end contayned his prayſe, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at <hi>Auguſtus</hi> commaundment he changed into the fable of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaeus.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19872:6"/>He finiſhed the

<hi>Muſitians</hi> in playes. When <hi>Cicero</hi> had heard certen of the verſes, and by and by through ſharpe iudgment percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that they procéeded from no commune veyne: he willed that the whole
<hi>Ecloge</hi> ſhuld be reade from the beginninge. Wherto when he had attended diligently, in the end he ſaid theſe words <hi>Of mighty Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me a ſecond hope,</hi> as though himſelf were the firſt hope of the

<hi>Aeneidos,</hi> for thoſe were his words: he refuſed ſo to doe. To whom yet not longe after when the matter was fully perfected, he recited thre bookes, namely the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Fourth and the Sixt.

He ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned glorie, that when ſome aſcribed to them ſelues certen of his verſes, and therfore were accoumpted the better learned, he tooke it not only not diſpleaſantly, but he much reioyſed therat. And makinge a couple of verſes contayninge the prayſe and felicitie of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which were ſet vpon the gates with out name, the verſes were theſe.</p>

            </q>
            <p>The authour of which verſes <hi>Auguſtus</hi> longe made enquirie for, but he could not finde him. At length when none came,
<hi>Bathyllus</hi> an indifferent good Poet, aſcribed them vnto himſelf, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore encoraged, and rewarded by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which
<hi>Virgill</hi> not takynge well, ſet vpon the ſame gates this beginning foure times: <hi>So you, not for your ſelues. Auguſtus</hi> required that theſe verſes ſhould bée by ſome finiſhed, which many aſſaying in vayne: <hi>Virgil</hi> thus replied, to the forewritten
<hi>Diſthic.</hi>
            </p>
            <q> 
               <hi>Theſe verſes</hi> I <hi>did make, therof another tooke the prayſe.</hi>
               <l>So you not for your ſelues, poore birds, your neſtes do build in trees</l>

            </q>
            <p>Which beyng once knowne: <hi>Bathyllus</hi> for a time was all the ieſt ingſtocke to the whole citie of <hi>ROME.</hi> When on a time he had the workes of <hi>Ennius</hi> in his hande, and beyng demaunded by one what he did with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: anſwered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gathered golde out of <hi>Ennius</hi> dounge. For that authour expreſſeth worthy ſentences &amp; matter, vnder words not of the fineſt. Vnto <hi>Auguſtus</hi> that demaunded of him how a Citie might beſt be gouerned: he anſwered, if the wiſeſt men did holde the helme, and good men were ſet in aucthoritie ouer euell, and ſo that the beſt men may haue their due honour, and the reſt be not in iuriouſly dealt withall. Then <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> what thing is it (ꝙ he) that neuer bringeth lothſomneſſe to man? The likeneſſe, anſwered
<hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> or the abundance of euery thinge, anoyeth vs, except of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng. He aſked moreouer, how a man might alwayes preſerue his happie and fortunate ſtate? To whom then <hi>Maro,</hi> if by how much he excell other in Honour, and Ritches: he endeuour to excell them in Liberalitie an Iuſtice. He was wount alſo to ſay, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng more méet nor commodious for a man then Pacience, and that<pb facs="tcp:19872:8"/>there was no fortune ſo ſharpe which by wiſely tolleratyng a valient man might not ouercome. Which opinion of his, he hath expreſſed in the fiſt of the
<hi>Aeneidos.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>O Goddeſſe ſun, where deſtnies drawes &amp; driues: let vs go there,</l>
               <l>What euer it is, who conquer fortune will, muſt fortune beare.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There was familiar with <hi>Auguſtus</hi> one named
<hi>Filiſtus,</hi> an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and méetly wel learned in Poetrie, and had a pleaſant, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able witte, and vſed to carpe the ſaiynges of all men, not to th'intent thereby to learne the truth (for ſo
<hi>Socrates</hi> was woont to do) but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to appeare the better learned. The ſame, whereſoeuer he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to méete with
<hi>Virgil</hi> or be in his companie, vſed to prouoke him with reproches, and floutes. Wherfore, either he departed commonly with ſilence, or els with bluſſhing held his peace. Then when as in preſence of
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> he ſayde that <hi>Virgil</hi> was dumbe, and that if he had a toongue he coulde not defend himſelf: hold thy peace babler (ꝙ he) for this taciturnitie of myne cauſeth <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and
<hi>Mecoenas</hi> to be the patrones of my cauſe, and when I liſt I will ſpeake with ſuche a trumpet, that ſhall euerywhere, and very longe be heard. And thou with thy pratlyng doſt not only breake mens eares, but walles alſo. Then the Emperour looked vpon <hi>Filiſtus</hi> with a fierce countenance, and rebuked him. And <hi>Virgil, Caeſar</hi> (ꝙ he) if this man knew a time to holde his peace: he would ſeldome ſpeake. For a man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be ſilent, vntill ſuch time as his ſilence ſhall either hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his talke may profit others.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had obtayned the Empire, he debated with him ſelf whether it were better to reſigne vp the Dominion, and commit the ſtate to yéerely <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and the gouernment of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to the <hi>Senate.</hi> In which caſe he called to counſell twayne, of two ſeuerall opinions, <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa. Agrippa</hi> in longe diſcourſe ſhewed, that although it were not very decent for him to do, yet would it be profitable, which contrarie,
<hi>Mecoenas</hi> very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him from. By occaſion wherof,
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> minde was brought into great perplexitie, for their ſundrie opinions, were confirmed by ſundrie reaſons. Wherfore he demaunded of <hi>Maro,</hi> whether it were expedient for a priuate man, to vſurpe a gouernment in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth or not? Then <hi>Virgil,</hi> vnto all (ꝙ he) that haue vſurped the ſtate of their commonwealth, the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath bin wearyſom both vnto them, and to the ſubiectes, bycauſe that of neceſſitie through<pb facs="tcp:19872:9"/>hatred of the people, or ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> growinge to them of their owne great iniuſtice: they do liue in much feare. But if the citizens could finde eny one, whom they do loue entierly: it ſhould be profitable to the citie, if he were ſet in auctoritie. Wherfore, if you do continue to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iuſtice to all men, without regard of eny perſon, as you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie begunne, it ſhalbe moſt profitable both for your ſelf, and all the worlde that you ruled, for you haue ſo much the goodwill of all men, that they honour you, and repute you for a God. Whoſe opinion <hi>Caeſar</hi> allowinge: retayned ſtill the Empire.</p>
            <p>But ſince wée haue now breifly ſpoken of the auctour, it ſéemeth good wée ſpeake of the kind of verſe, which commonly is handled two maner wayes, that is to ſay, before the worke, and in the worke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worke are, the Title, the Cauſe, the Intention. The Title, in which is aſked, whoſe it is. The cauſe, from whence it roſe, and for what cauſe cheifly they Poet tooke this in hand to write. The Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the which is knowne his drift, &amp; where about the Poet goeth. In the worke thrée thinges are marked, the Numbre, the Ordre, the Explanation. Although therfore by falſification, manie workes are caried abroade vnder othermens names, as the tragedie of <hi>Thieſtes</hi> made by this Poet, which <hi>Varrus</hi> ſetforth for his owne, &amp; manie ſuch like: yet we cannot doubt but that cléerly the <hi>Bucolickes</hi> are
<hi>Virgills,</hi> eſpecially ſince the Poete, doubtinge ſome ſuch matter, both in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge of the <hi>Aeneidos,</hi> and in another place witneſſeth that they are his, ſayinge:</p>
            <q>
               <l>I that my ſlendre Ote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pipe in verſe was wont to ſound.
<hi>Likewiſe</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I that the rimes of sheapheardes ſunge, and rash in tendre yeeres,</l>
               <l>Thee <hi>Tityrus</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That they be fitly termed <hi>Bucolickes,</hi> and ſo accompted: if nothing els declared, yet this might be proofe ſufficient, that in
<hi>Theocritus</hi> they be called by the ſame name. But we muſt ſhew alſo ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. There be thrée kindes of Sheapheardes that are famous in <hi>Buco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lickes.</hi> Wherof the vileſt ſort are termed
<hi>Caprarii,</hi> or Goatheardes. The <hi>Opiliones,</hi> or Sheapheards are next of dignity, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Bubulci,</hi> or Cowheardes are the beſt and chiefeſt. Wherof therfore was it moſt conuenient that the Sheapheardes verſe ſhuld be named, but of that degrée which is found moſt excellent amongſt Sheapheardes?</p>
            <p>The cauſe may be two wayes conſidered, of the beginninge of the verſe, and of the minde of the writer. Of the beginninge, and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:19872:9"/>of the <hi>Bucolick</hi> verſe: diuers haue aſſigned diuerſe cauſes. There are ſome that ſaye this kinde of verſe was firſt inſtituted to <hi>Diana,</hi> by the Sheapheardes of
<hi>Lacedaemonia,</hi> when through occaſion of warre, which at that tyme the
<hi>Perſians</hi> made vpon all <hi>Greece,</hi> the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins could not do ſacrafice accordinge to their cuſtome. Others ſome ſay, that the ſame kynde of verſe was made to <hi>Diana</hi> by <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> when he wandred about <hi>Sicilia.</hi> What euer they all ſay, this is moſt certen, that the <hi>Bucolik</hi> verſe, tooke beginninge of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, when men ledde only ſheapheardes liues, and therefore the ſimplicitie of ſuch perſonages doth repreſent a ſhewe of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wordle. Wherfore <hi>Virgil</hi> begunne very commendably with thoſe, verſes, as it were, with that life, which was firſt in the earth. For afterward the fieldes were tilled, and laſt of all, for eara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fertyle ground: contention roſe, and warres enſued, which <hi>Virgil,</hi> that he would expreſſe: ſange firſt of ſheapheardes, next of Huſbandmen, and laſt of warriours. It remayneth now that wée conſider what cauſe mooued the Poet cheifly to write the <hi>Bucolickes.</hi> Ether he was entiſed by the ſwéetnes to haue <hi>Theocritus</hi> verſe in admiration, or elſe for orders ſake he ſought to expreſſe the life of man, as wée haue ſayd before. Or rather that <hi>Virgil</hi> would ſetfoorth the thrée kindes of <hi>Elocution,</hi> which the
<hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Carecters, Iſchnon</hi> that is, lowe,
<hi>Adron</hi> which is loftie, <hi>Meſon,</hi> that is the mean or middle. Whefore beinge likely that he which was right cunninge in all the kindes: endited his <hi>Bucolickes</hi> in the firſt, the <hi>Georgikes</hi> in the ſecond, and the <hi>Aeneidos</hi> in the third. Or therfore it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed he wroat the <hi>Bucolickes</hi> firſt, to thintent in that kind of verſe which is more frée and rough then the reſt he might take opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to currie the Emperours fauour, and to recouer his lande which he had loſt, for this cauſe. The third day of the <hi>Ides</hi> of March, when <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> was ſtayne, and the old ſouldiours had taken vp <hi>Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> beinge but a child to be their captayne, the ſenate not much repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge againſt it, a ciuile warre riſinge therof, the <hi>Cremone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes</hi> with other of the ſame faction, aided the aduerſaries of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> Wherby it came to paſſe that when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had the victory he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the old ſouldiours ſhuld be brought in to the <hi>Cremonen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes</hi> fieldes, to deuide, and poſſeſſe them. And when their fieldes were not ſufficient for them all: their neighbours the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> amonge whom was
<hi>Virgil,</hi> loſt a great part of their landes, by cauſe they lay
<pb facs="tcp:19872:10"/>neare vnto the <hi>Cremonenſes.</hi> But <hi>Virgil,</hi> preſuminge on the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie which he had with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and on his owne verſes: durſt reſiſt <hi>Arius</hi> the <hi>Centurian.</hi> He ſtrait wayes, like a ſouldyour, put his hand to his ſword. And when
<hi>Virgil</hi> had betake himſelf to flight: he left not of followinge him, vntill <hi>Virgil</hi> had caſt himſelf into a riuer, and ſo eſcaped. But afterward through the fauour of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and <hi>Pollio,</hi> and
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf, he was reſtoared to his landes. The Intention of the booke which the <hi>Graetians</hi> call <hi>Scopus,</hi> is grounded on the imitation of <hi>Theocritus</hi> the Poet, who was both a <hi>Sicilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> and a <hi>Syracuſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo is to be reduced into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and other princes and noblemen by whoſe meanes he was brought againe into his former ſeat, &amp; liuing. Wherby y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the end might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine both delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; profect: he did althinge accordinge to ordre, &amp; precept.</p>
            <p>This queſtion is ſometime aſked why he wroate no moe then ten <hi>Ecloges,</hi> which wilbe no meruayle vnto him that ſhall waigh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of the paſtorall <hi>Scenes,</hi> which cannot be ſtretched beyonde this numbre, and ſince this Poet more circumſpect then
<hi>Theocritus</hi> as the matter it ſelf declareth, ſéemeth to doubt leaſt that <hi>Ecloge</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Pollio,</hi> will not appeare ruſticklike enough, whiche he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after this maner, ſaying:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sicilian Muſes, of thinges ſumdeale greater let vs ſinge.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe doth he in other twayne. And this wée foretell to be obſerued in al the <hi>Bucolikes</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that they are neither wholy deſtitute of figures, neither altogither full of figures, that is to ſay <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagories.</hi> Theſe thinges are ſcarce to be graunted vnto <hi>Virgiſ,</hi> for the prayſe of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and to recouer his landes, ſince <hi>Theocritus,</hi> whom <hi>Virgil</hi> ſought by all endeuour to imitate: wroate altogether plainly, and ſimply.</p>
            <p>As touchyng ſuch thinges as accuſtomably are handled in the verſe are theſe: Numbre, Order, Explanation The numbre of the
<hi>Eclogs</hi> is apparant, for there are Ten, of which, ſeuen are thought properly to deſerue the name of <hi>Bucolickes.</hi> For the laſt thrée ought not to be called <hi>Bucolickes,</hi> namely <hi>Pollio, Silenus,</hi> and <hi>Gallus.</hi> The firſt therfore contayneth a publique complaint, and a priuate thankes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng for land, and is called
<hi>Tityrus.</hi> The ſecond, the loue of a boy, and is termed
<hi>Alexis.</hi> The third, a contention of Sheapheards, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Paloemon.</hi> The fourth, <hi>Genethliacum,</hi> and is named
<hi>Pollio.</hi> The fift, <hi>Epitaphium,</hi> and is termed <hi>Daphnis.</hi> The ſixt, <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19872:10"/>and is called,
<hi>Varus,</hi> and <hi>Cilenus.</hi> The ſeuenth <hi>Pharmacentria.</hi> The eight, the loues of diuers ſexes, and is named <hi>Damon.</hi> The ninth contayneth a complaynt for his loſt landes, and is termed <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> The tenth, the diſier of <hi>Gallus,</hi> and is called <hi>Gallus.</hi> As touchynge the order of them, wée muſt vnderſtand this, that only in the firſt and laſt <hi>Ecloges</hi> the Poete would keep due order, for in the one he began, as he witneſſeth in the <hi>Georgickes:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>O <hi>Tityrus,</hi> of thee I ſange, vnder the broad Beech tree.</l>
            </q>
            <p> In the other he ſhewed the end, when he ſayth,</p>
            <q>
               <l>This finall trauayle mine, graunt <hi>Arethuſa</hi> vnto mee.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But amongſt the <hi>Eclogs</hi> that there is no ſheapheardly, or preſcript order obſerued, it is moſt certen. Wherefore there are ſome, that ſay the <hi>Bucolikes</hi> begin not at <hi>Tityrus,</hi> but:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Our <hi>Muſe</hi> in <hi>Syracuſian</hi> verſe vouchſaued firſt to play.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There remaineth now Explanation, vnto which before wée come, I muſt admoniſh this, that the verſe of a <hi>Bucolike</hi> is but a ſtender verſe, and ſo farre differyng from the ſtile of the
<hi>Heroike:</hi> that this kinde of verſe hath his peculiar diuiſion, and cuttinges, and is diſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by his owne proper lawes. For, ſince a verſe is prooued by thrée thynges, cutting, ſcannyng, and tunyng: it is no <hi>Bucolike</hi> verſe vnleſſe the firſt foote do contayne a full part of the ſenſe, and the third foote be <hi>Trochaeus</hi> and a cuttyng, and the third being rather a <hi>Dactile</hi> then a
<hi>Spondeus:</hi> do finiſh a parcell of ſenſe, the fift and ſixt féete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of whole words. Which beyng obſerued by
<hi>Theocritus,</hi> yet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at length through difficultie of the worke: he neclected it, &amp; only in the beginnyng it is vncertayne whether diligence, or chaunce did kéep theſe cuttynges. For, <hi>Tityre,</hi> a <hi>Dactile</hi> finiſſhed part of the Oration: <hi>tu patu, lae re cu,</hi> cloaſed vp the third <hi>Trochaeus,</hi> though in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde word: <hi>bans ſub,</hi> and when he had put the fourth <hi>Spondeus</hi> for a <hi>Dactile, tegmine fagi,</hi> when he had ended the partes of oration, he abſolued the whole <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma,</hi> wherin the diligence of
<hi>Theocritus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all his verſes is wounderfull. And he that ſhall diligently with ſharpe iudgement conſider the aboue written, ſhall eaſely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is the intention of the <hi>Georgikes,</hi> and what the ende, and likewiſe alſo in the <hi>Aeneidos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are thrée kinde of ſtiles in a Poeme, ether Actiue, ether Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue which <hi>Graecians</hi> call <hi>Dramaticum,</hi> wherein are perſons brought<pb facs="tcp:19872:11"/>in ſpeakinge, without ſpeakyng of the Poet, ſuch as <hi>Tragoedies,</hi> and <hi>Comoedies</hi> are.

               <p>¶ <hi>Aeneas</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Dido,</hi> declareth the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Troy,</hi> which was after this maner. The
<hi>Greekes</hi> in the tenth yeare of their ſledge, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their force was quailed, and diſtruſtinge their owne abititie: fell vnto crafts, and ſubtilties, and counterfaytyng a flight the night before the towne was burned: hid them ſelues in the Ile of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> leauyng in the
<hi>Troiane</hi> fields a wodden horſe of ſuch ineſteemable bigneſſe, that it could not be receaued in at the Citie gates, and in his wombe they encloſed the moſt valient ſouldiers of al theyr nobiliti. The
<hi>Troians</hi> perſwaded partly through the ſubtiltie of <hi>SINON,</hi> and partly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde by <hi>LAOCONS</hi> puniſhment: pull downe part of their towne walle, and ſo bryng in this horſe into their Caſtle. But in the dead time of the night the <hi>Graetians</hi> returnyng from <hi>Tenedos</hi> entred into the citie through the ſame bretch whiche was made to brynge in the Horſe. <hi>SINON</hi> openeth the wombe of the Horſe and letteth foorth the armed men, who immediatly ſpoyle all with fier, and ſworde. Whyles theſe thynges were doyng, <hi>Aeneas</hi> is warned in his dreame by
<hi>Hector</hi> to prouide for himſelf by flight, and to deliuer his country Gods from the fier. But he preferryng an honorable death, before a cowardly flight: in vayne betaketh him to armes, wherin at the firſt aſſault the
<hi>Troians</hi> had the vpperhande, vntill, followyng the counſell of
<hi>Choroebus,</hi> they put on <hi>Greekiſh</hi> armour, and ſo one of them ſlew another. Then <hi>Priamus</hi> pallayce is beſieged, and
<hi>Priamus</hi> ſlayne by <hi>Pyrrhus, Achilles</hi> ſonne. Thus, when
<hi>Aeneas</hi> had aſſayed all thynges in vayne, when he was now quite out of hope: betaketh the reliques to his father <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> and takyng him vp on his ſhoulders, with <hi>Aſcanius</hi> his ſonne, and
<hi>Creuſa</hi> his wife: committeth himſelf to flight. The
<hi>Graetians</hi> follow faſt after, and in that tumult he loſt his wife
<hi>Creuſa,</hi> vppon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſeeke whom, when as he wandred about all the towne: he met with her ghoſt, who certified him that ſhe was dead. He returnes agayne to his companie, whether as now were come together a great numbre of men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ready to follow him whether ſo euer he would carie them.</p>

And beyng there afflicted with a great plague of peſtilence: was warned by his houſhold Godds in his ſleape, that he ſhould leaue <hi>Creta,</hi> and goe to <hi>Italy.</hi> In which iorney, by a tempeſt he was driuen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ilandes <hi>Strophades,</hi> and there much troubled by the <hi>Harpyes,</hi> and ſhortly after arryuyng at
<hi>Actium:</hi> made playes in the honour of <hi>Apollo.</hi> From thence he ſayled by <hi>Corcyra</hi> into <hi>Epyrus,</hi> wheras <hi>Helenus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of <hi>Priamus</hi> raygned, that maried <hi>Andromache</hi> after the death of <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> By whom he was courteouſly entertayned, and admoniſhed by him of the perils which he ſhould ſubſtayne both by ſea and land. From thence he ſayleth to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and paſſyng alonge by the firſt ſhoare of <hi>Italy;</hi> arriueth on that ſide that lieth neare to the Mounte <hi>Aetna,</hi> and there he receaueth
<hi>Achaemenides</hi> who was left in the <hi>Cyclops</hi> den by
<hi>Vliſſes,</hi> anon from thence he hoyſeth ſayle as <hi>Helenus</hi> commaunded, and paſſeth by <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Carybdis.</hi> And coaſtyng along the ſhoare of <hi>Scycilye</hi> taketh lance at
<hi>Drepanus,</hi> where <hi>Anchiſes</hi> partly weakened by age, and partly by trauayle ended his life. From thence ſaylyng towards <hi>Italy:</hi> was driuen into <hi>Affrike</hi> by a tempeſtuous weather rayſed by

Then, turnynge her ſelf to the <hi>Troian</hi> youth, whiche then haply was buſied in huntyng: bringeth vnto theyr hands a tame ſtag which was dearly beloued among
<hi>Tyrrheus</hi> the kynges heardmans children. Whom when <hi>Aſcanius</hi> had wounded with an arowe, the huſbandmen betakyng them ſelues to weapon, ſet vpon the <hi>Troians.

               <p>¶ Whylſt <hi>Aeneas</hi> is buſie in <hi>Tuſcia</hi> to ſeeke ayde, <hi>Turnus</hi> is by the <hi>Raynbow</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed not to omit ſo good an occaſion, and ſpeadeth him ſelf forth as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are as he can to his enemyes. Who ſeing them defenſed on euery ſide in theyr tentes to the intent that he might cut away from them all hope of flight, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaieth to burne their fleete. But at <hi>Venus</hi> erneſt ſute:
<hi>Iupiter</hi> deliuered the ſhippes from preſent burning, and tranſformed them into ſo many <hi>Nymphes</hi> of the ſea. Towards night,
<hi>Turnus</hi> layeth a watch before the towne gates for feare of ſoddein eruptions of the enemie, in which watch <hi>Meſſapus</hi> is cheif. Therwhiles the <hi>Troians</hi> take counſell whom to ſende to
<hi>Aeneas</hi> to make him priuie of theſe thinges, which <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> a payer of faithful freendes take in hand to do. Who departyng forth of the towne, and findyng the watch ouercome with wyne and ſleape: ſley <hi>Rhamnetes</hi> with a numbre of <hi>Rutilians,</hi> &amp; lade them ſelues with the ſpoyles. But in the mornyng, beyng ſpied of
<hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcens</hi> horſemen: they flie to the woods. There
<hi>Eurialus</hi> by weight of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ignorance of the way much hindred, falleth into his foes handes &amp; is by <hi>Volſcens</hi> ſlayne.
<hi>Niſus</hi> likewiſe, when he had ſlayne <hi>Volſcens,</hi> and valient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenged <hi>Euryalus</hi> death beyng ſtrooke through with many a mortal wound falleth downe dead vpon his freends body. Their heads are caried vpon ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res poynts into the tentes, where the <hi>Troians</hi> knowyng them from the walles, a great ſorow riſeth through the whole towne.
<hi>Turnus</hi> ceaſeth not to aſſaulte his enemies with all force, and great ſlaughter is committed on both partes. There <hi>Aſcanius</hi> killeth with the ſhoot of an arow <hi>Numanus,</hi> that ouer proudly aduanced himſelf: <hi>Pandarus</hi> and <hi>Bitias</hi> proude of their good ſucceſſe, open the gate, and driue backe the enemies entryng in with great ſlaughter. Whereof <hi>Turnus</hi> beyng certefied: iſſueth into the towne through the open gate, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>Troians</hi> to flight, but at length oppreſſed with multitude, retyreth to the ſide of the towne which is next the riuer, and armed as he was, leapeth into the ſtreame, and ſo eſcapeth.</p>

               <p>¶ <hi>Iupiter</hi> callyng a parliament of Gods: exhorteth them to concorde, <hi>Venus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth of the <hi>Troians</hi> danger, and <hi>Iunos</hi> vnſaciable malice, and requireth at length ſome end of calamities. <hi>Iuno</hi> layeth all the blame in the <hi>Troians,</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt cauſers of war, &amp; in <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf. When
<hi>Iupiter</hi> perceaued they would grow to no agreement, to offend neither his wife nor his daughter: promiſeth to take part with nether, but will put of all to the indifferencie of deſtenies. This while the <hi>Rutilians</hi> returne to thaſſault with all their force, whom the aſſaulted repel with all their might, &amp; this in <hi>Latium. Aeneas</hi> hauyng braught al things in <hi>Etruria</hi> to wiſſhed end, beyng aſſiſted by diuers peoples: returneth to his mates with a nauie of thirtie ſayle. There he meeteth with the <hi>Nimphes</hi> that were not longe before tranſformed from ſhippes, and is by them certefied both of the loſſe of his fleet, and of the daunger of his men. Then he landeth his power within the ſight of his enemies. The <hi>Rutilians</hi> leaue the ſledge, and run to ſhoare to keepe the enemie from landyng. There they fight with greate loſſe on bothe ſides. Where <hi>Pallas,</hi> after many ſlaughters on his enemies: is at length ſlayne by <hi>Turnus.</hi> With ſorow wherof, <hi>Aeneas</hi> all enraged: maketh plenty bloudoffryngs on his foes for his freendes ſoule. Then
<hi>Aſcanius</hi> iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, and ioyneth power with his father.
<hi>Iuno</hi> carefull for <hi>Turnus,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth before his eyes a falſe repreſentation of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Which, whilſt he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth into a ſhip: <hi>Iuno</hi> breaketh the cables, and by force of a tempeſt, bringeth him to the ſhore neare <hi>Ardea. Mezentius</hi> then, at
<hi>Iupiters</hi> commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment, entreth the battle, and ſleyth many both
<hi>Troians</hi> and <hi>Etruſcans,</hi> vntil <hi>Aeneas</hi> haue wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and being reſcued by <hi>Lauſus</hi> his ſunne: is ſcarce able to departe the field <hi>Lauſus</hi> is alſo ſleyne by <hi>Aeneas</hi> whylſt he endeuoreth to reuenge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wounde. Which when
<hi>Mezentius</hi> vnderſtoode: he returneth into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and is ſleyne by the ſame hand that his ſunne was.</p>

               <p>¶ When the <hi>Latines</hi> were vanquiſhed,
<hi>Turnus</hi> ſeyng all his help to be repoſed in him ſelf, contrary to the perſwaſion of <hi>Latinus,</hi> and the Queenes manifolde teares: determineth to fight hande to hande with <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and ſendeth ſuche worde vnto him by <hi>Idmon</hi> his meſſenger. <hi>Aeneas</hi> is therwith pleaſed, and with ſolemne othes on both ſides they make the league, which
<hi>Iuturna</hi> through per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of <hi>Iuno</hi> in the ſhape of
<hi>Camertes,</hi> diſturbeth. Firſt of all, <hi>Tolumnius</hi> the ſouthſayer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by a falſe ſhew proficied victory to his ſide: ſtriketh through with a dart one of <hi>Gilippus</hi> ſunnes.
<hi>Aeneas</hi> likewiſe, ſeckyng meanes to appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſe the tumult: is wounded by an arow vncerten by whom it was ſhot, and is conſtrayned to leaue the battell. Which <hi>Turnus</hi> vnderſtandyng, ſuppoſing he had gotten a great occaſion of good ſucceſſe: maketh greate ſlaughter on his foes. <hi>Venus</hi> cureth her ſunne with <hi>Dyttany</hi> of <hi>Ida. Aeneas,</hi> amended: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth agayne forth, and reſcueth his mates, and namely calleth for <hi>Turnus</hi> in fight. But <hi>Turnus</hi> ſtill withdrawynge him ſelf (for <hi>Iuturna</hi> his ſiſter, in ſhape of
<hi>Metiſcus</hi> the wagoner, cariyng him alwayes aſide would not ſuffre him mecte with <hi>Aeneas</hi> in battle) he determineth to beſiedge the towne, and Ieadyng his amny nere to the walles caſteth fier vp to the Turrets, and houſes. Then <hi>Amata</hi> ſuppoſing that <hi>Turnus</hi> was ſlayne: through extreame ſorow hangeth her ſelf. Theſe thynges beyng tolde vnto <hi>Turnus</hi> by <hi>sages</hi> ſeyng that he muſt needes fight, or ſuffer his confederate towne come into his enemies hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face: voluntarely prouoketh <hi>Aeneas</hi> to the combat according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the league. In which fight <hi>Aeneas</hi> hauyng the victory, and beynge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt mooued to take compaſſion, and graunt life to his enemie: yet when he ſaw the gyrdle vpon his ſhoulder whiche he had taken from <hi>Pallas,</hi> whom he had ſlayne before, ſodenly mooued with anger: thruſteth him to the hart.</p>

               <l>He ſhakyng then his head: tis not thy bitter wordes that me</l>

               <l>He ſayd no more, but ſtrait a mightie ſtone he there behelde,</l>
               <l>A mighty auntient ſtone, that then by chaunce within the felde</l>

               <l>But he nor when he came, nor when he went to minde doth call,</l>
               <l>Or when he lifted vp his hande, or when the ſtone he threw.</l>
               <l>His knées do fayle, and through his bloud a chilly colde there flew.</l>
               <l>The ſtone then rowlyng through the emptie ayer his way did take,</l>
               <l>But foorth at full it did not flie, nor yet the mark it ſtrake.</l>

               <l>Nor with ſuch clappe the lightninge bright out of high heauen doth braſt.</l>

            <head>Maſter Phaers Concluſion to his interpretation of the
<hi>Aeneidos</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> by him conuerted into English verſe.</head>
            <p>THus farfourth (good readers) aſwell for defence of my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (which I haue heard diſcommended of manie, and eſteemed of ſome to be more than barbarous) as alſo for honeſt recreation of you the nobilitie, gentlemen and Ladies that ſtudie no <hi>Latine,</hi> I haue taken ſome trauaile to expreſſe this moſt excellent writer, as far as my ſimple abilitie extended. And if god ſende me life and leiſour, I purpoſe to ſet forthe the reſt, vnleſſe it maye lyke ſome other that is better armed with learning, to preuent my labours, whereof I aſſure you, I woulde be right glad, contenting my ſelfe ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly with this, that by mee firſt this gate is ſet open. If nowe the yong writers wil voucheſaue to enter: they may find in this language, both large and abundant campes of varietie, where in they may gather innumerable ſortes, of moſt beautifull floures, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and phraſes, not onely to ſupplie the imperfection of mee: but alſo to garnishe al kindes of their owne verſes with a more cleane and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious order of meeter, than heretofore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly hath ben accuſtomed. And if any further help I may do to that purpoſe, I ſhal more gladly beſtowe my trauaile hereafter, if I may knowe that theſe my beginnings be of you gently taken and embraced. Truſting that you my right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful maiſters, and ſtudentes of <hi>Vniuerſities,</hi> and ſuch as be teachers of children and readers of this auctour in
<hi>Latin,</hi> wil not be to muche offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though euery verſe anſwere not to your expectation. For (beſides the diuerſitie betweene a conſtruction and a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlation) you know there be many miſticall ſecretes in this writer, which vttered in English would ſhewe litle pleaſour, and in myne opinion are better to be vntouched, than to diminishe the grace of the reſt with tediouſnes and darknes. I ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue therefore folowed the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of <hi>Horace,</hi> teaching the duety of a good interpretour, <hi>Qui quae deſperat niteſcere poſſe, relinquit,</hi> by which occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſomwhat I haue in places omitted, ſomwhat altered, and ſome thing I haue expounded, and al to the eaſe of inferior readers, for you that are learned need not to be inſtructed. I meane not to preiudice any that can do finer, only I deſyre you to beare with my trauaile, and among other to pardon my firſt booke, wherein I found this new kinde of fingering ſomewhat ſtraunge vnto me, and to ſay the truth I had neuer any quiet from troubles, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fer or peruſe that booke, or any of the reſt, as I moſt<pb facs="tcp:19872:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>deſyred. You may therefore accept them, as thinges roughly begunne, rather than polished, and where you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a faute, I deſier you, with ſilence paciently paſſe it, and vpon knowledge geuen to mee, I ſhal in the next ſetting forth, endeuour to reforme it. And if anye with this wil not be contented, than let him take it in hand, and doe it a new him ſelf, and I nothinge miſtruſte, but he ſhal find it an eaſier thing to controlle a peece or two, than to amende the whole of this enterpretation. Thus I commit you to god gentle Readers, and I praye you correct theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours eſcaped in the printing.</p>
